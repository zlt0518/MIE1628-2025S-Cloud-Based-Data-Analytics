For this assignment, I do not recommend installing Hadoop on your local machine provided by instructor as it will take tons of time to firgure out useless version errors

I suggest working on this assignmnet using docker(I am using Windows) with MapReduce and using Java instead of python as programming language.

Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Install Linux on Windows with WSL(Prerequisite for Docker using linux): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Docker Installation for windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

Setting up Hadoop with Docker and using MapReduce framework: https://medium.com/@guillermovc/setting-up-hadoop-with-docker-and-using-mapreduce-framework-c1cd125d4f7b

The entire installation should take less than 20 min
