# MIE1628 A1 Suggestions

Installing Hadoop is arguably the HARDEST part of this assignment, and maybe even the hardest part of the entire course!

For this assignment, I do not recommend installing Hadoop on your local machine as per instructions provided by the instructor since it will take tons of time to firgure out useless version errors 🫠

If you use Windows, I suggest working on this assignment using docker with MapReduce and using Java instead of Python as programming language 
(FYI: I could not manage to get Python work on Docker after trying multiple methods for a few hours...So I do not suggest you to waste your time on that LOL)

Relevent Links:

- Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

- Install Linux on Windows with WSL(Prerequisite for Docker using Windows): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

- Docker Installation for windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

- Setting up Hadoop with Docker and using MapReduce framework: https://medium.com/@guillermovc/setting-up-hadoop-with-docker-and-using-mapreduce-framework-c1cd125d4f7b

The entire installation should take less than 1 hr

If you are a Mac/Linux user, I don’t have any specific suggestions, but there should be similar tutorials available.

Enjoy～🫶




PS.
Honestly, I feel like the difficulty of this assignment was intentionally designed to scare people away and make them drop the course😅
