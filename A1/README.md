# MIE1628 A1 Suggestions for Windows User

Installing Hadoop is the HARDEST part of this assignment even the hardest part of the entire course!

For this assignment, I do not recommend installing Hadoop on your local machine as per instructions provided by the instructor since it will take tons of time to firgure out useless version errors :(

If you use Windows, I suggest working on this assignmnet using docker with MapReduce and using Java instead of python as programming language 
(FYI: I could not manage to get python work on Docker...So do not waste time to try that LOL)

Setting up Hadoop with Docker and using MapReduce framework: https://medium.com/@guillermovc/setting-up-hadoop-with-docker-and-using-mapreduce-framework-c1cd125d4f7b

The entire installation should take less than 1 hr

Enjoy~
