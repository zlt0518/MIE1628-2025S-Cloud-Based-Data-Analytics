# MIE1628 A4 Suggestions
Using Microsoft Azure is mandatory for this assignment.

I encountered some issues when loading original gender_jobs_distribution2.csv as there are several NAs exists in some columns, and resulted in the failure of triggering copy piplining. Thus, I suggest before uploading to your storage account container, use your text editor(eg. Visual Studio Code) open the CSV, find: NA → Replace with: (leave blank). 

**Feedback:**
